### Small introduction for this documentation

This documentation's main purpose is to set a solid understanding about computers and how you can develop on them. After many resources red I've realised that the materials that wear public are not that detailed and also do not offer all the informations. If the whole material is understood you will have a deep knowledge in this domains

* [Reasoning and Logic](broken-reference)
* [Computer Organization](broken-reference)
* [Object Oriented Programming](broken-reference)
* Calculus
* Algorithms
* Data Structures
* Web and Database Technology
* Linear Algebra
* Information and Data Management
* Probability Theory and Statistics
* Software Quality and Testing
* Computer Networks
* Computer Graphics
* Machine Learning
* Big Data Processing
* Algorithm Design
* Software Engineering Methods
* Embedded Software
* Automata, Computability and Complexity
* Concepts of Programming Languages
* Operating Systems

All of this subjects are going to be detailed with many other informations so that they are connected with eachother. I consider that this makes a good programmer, the fact that you know the relations between each process.
