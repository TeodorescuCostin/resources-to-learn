# Mathematical Proof

In mathematics it is very important to have a correct proof. A proof it is made from a sequence of statements where each statement is either an assumption or follows by a rule of logic.&#x20;

Now that we have had defined our subject of discussion let's take an example so that we understand all of this terms. Basically we will combine some concept from mathematics with our terms that were already defined in logic.

Let's say we would want to prove that $$n^2$$ is an even number, for any <mark style="color:red;">n</mark> that is a positive integer and is even. If we want to do this than we will need to take an arbitrary value <mark style="color:red;">k</mark>, where <mark style="color:red;">k</mark> is a positive integer.

So until now we know that $$n=2*k$$ and we also <mark style="color:red;">n</mark> is an even number. Now we can apply our knowledge in mathematics so we should do the $$n^2$$ which in ou case is $$n^2=n*n=2*k*2*k=4*k^2$$ which is an even number.

A more logical representation of our problem would be <img src="../../.gitbook/assets/FORALL.png" alt="" data-size="line"> n( P(n)<img src="../../.gitbook/assets/IMPLIES.png" alt="" data-size="line">Q(n)), where P(n) represents "n is even" and Q(n) represents "$$n^2$$ is even".



Now that we already know what would mean "Mathematical Proof" we can start looking on how to write a proof. This is very important because it is very similar with mathematics but also can define how our statement would look like.

Another important factor that is in our discussion is that definitions allow very complex ideas to be summarized as a single term. One more key factor is that we need to use the asumptions that are called in hypothesis.

A proof is a logical argument, but there are not that many basic rules, so the same patterns keep showing up over and over. The most common paterns are usually the ones that attempt to prove something "for all" or "for every", etc. . Usually this will be represented as "Let x be an arbitrary entity in the domain of the discourse. We want to show P(x)", which can be called a proof by generalisation.&#x20;

There are going to be ases where we should prove that an entity satisfies a condition, which would be called existence proof.&#x20;

Now we should thing what should we do if we need to disprove a complete statement. The answer is simple, we just need to negate the whole statement.
