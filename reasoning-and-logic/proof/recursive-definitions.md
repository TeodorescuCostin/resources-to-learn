# Recursive Definitions

A popular example for this topic would be Fibonacci numbers. Usually recurion in any function means that the function calls it self, but this is not all because if we do not define a base case then the function will not finish. Usually we define a base case and after that we build on top of it.

Now that we've defined what it is a recursive function we should start thinking on how to prove something.
