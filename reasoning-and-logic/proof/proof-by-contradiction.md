# Proof by Contradiction

Now we will use principle already common to us and that is proof by contradiction. To do this we should simply negate our proposition and presum that is true already. Doing that we will find a case which satisfies our needs.

Usually the false statement that is derived in a proof by contradiction is of the form p<img src="../../.gitbook/assets/AND.png" alt="" data-size="line"><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/NOT.png" alt="" data-size="line">p.

This is a very simple concept but to fully understand it you shoul work on it.
