# Mathematical Induction

Induction in mathematics is very simple, though when you first read it may be kind of hard. The core principle is if we can prove that the proposition P(n), is true for any n than our proposition will be tru also for P(n+1). The effect is very similar with the efect of domino.&#x20;

So if we prove that P(1) is true and P(1)<img src="../../.gitbook/assets/IMPLIES.png" alt="" data-size="line">P(2) are true, we can conclude that P(2) is true from modus ponens. We can extend our example for any number.&#x20;

We can usually say for any given n where n is in the set of <img src="../../.gitbook/assets/NATURALNUMBERS.png" alt="" data-size="line">, we can continue the deduction for n steps.

Usually we will not prove for all the cases, because this is the point of induction, to minimize our work. We will simply say <img src="../../.gitbook/assets/FORALL.png" alt="" data-size="line">k( P(k) <img src="../../.gitbook/assets/IMPLIES.png" alt="" data-size="line"> P(k+1)). In mathematics we need to do another step before proving the above statement and that is P(0), so if we prove P(0) <img src="../../.gitbook/assets/AND.png" alt="" data-size="line">( <img src="../../.gitbook/assets/FORALL.png" alt="" data-size="line">k( P(k) <img src="../../.gitbook/assets/IMPLIES.png" alt="" data-size="line"> P(k+1))), then we can deduce that <img src="../../.gitbook/assets/FORALL.png" alt="" data-size="line">n(P(n)) is true.

First part is called the base case. If we prove P(0), the base case, we are half done. after that we have the statement  <img src="../../.gitbook/assets/FORALL.png" alt="" data-size="line">k( P(k) <img src="../../.gitbook/assets/IMPLIES.png" alt="" data-size="line"> P(k+1)), which is the general case. In the general case we will take an arbitrary value in our domain of definition and we should prove that as well.

Let's take a general example where we should prove that $$2*n+1$$ is odd. We already know that but for the sake of this example let's take it as it is. First we should prove the base case so if we note our statement with P we should prove P(0). This will result $$2*0+1=0+1=1$$. This is true because 1 is odd so that we can go to the next part, which is  <img src="../../.gitbook/assets/FORALL.png" alt="" data-size="line">k( P(k) <img src="../../.gitbook/assets/IMPLIES.png" alt="" data-size="line"> P(k+1)). Here we will assume that P(k) is already true, so that we need to prove P(k+1). In this part if we already know that $$2*k+1$$ is true we will use it in our demonstration for P(k+1). Here P(k+1) is represented by $$2*(k+1)+1=2*k+2+1=(2*k+1)+2$$. From this we already know that $$2*k+1$$and that will result we already know it is an odd number. We also know that is we add an even number to any odd number the result will also be odd. So in our case we add 2 to an odd number so that it will result $$2*(k+1)+1$$is odd so P(k+1) is odd. So this will mean that our statement is true for any n that is an integer.
