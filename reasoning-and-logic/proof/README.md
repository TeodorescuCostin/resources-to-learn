# Proof

Logical proofs are closely related to mathematical proofs. This two subjects are corelated because when a result has been prooven, it will be and remain solid.&#x20;

#### Time for some History :smile:!

Until the middle of 19th century the statements of mathematics were regarded as statements about the world. In that period a proof was more like a convincing argument rather than a chain of logical presented arguments.

For almost two thousand years the geometry of the Greek mathematician Euclid was accepted as it was. It was considered as the geometry of the world.&#x20;

Overall mathematics is the foundation for any logical concept that we use today.
