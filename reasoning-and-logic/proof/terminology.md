# Terminology

Now, that we've define the base for mathematics proof, let's define the terminology.

* If we want to define natural numbers, we have the symbol denoted <img src="../../.gitbook/assets/NATURALNUMBERS.png" alt="" data-size="line">, we need to keep in mind that the sum and the product of two natural numbers will result also a natural number.
* If we want to define integers we have the symbol <img src="../../.gitbook/assets/INTEGERS.png" alt="" data-size="line">, which defines the signed numbers, the sum and the product of two integers will result an integer.
* If we want to define rational numbers we can do that with the symbol <img src="../../.gitbook/assets/RATIONALNUMBERS.png" alt="" data-size="line"> , which defines numbers that can be written as fractions.
* If we want to define real numbers we have the symbol <img src="../../.gitbook/assets/REALNUMBERS.png" alt="" data-size="line">, which represents the numbers that can be written in decimal form.
* We also have irrational numbers, this numbers represent the real numbers but minus the rational numbers. To represent this we will use <img src="../../.gitbook/assets/REALNUMBERS.png" alt="" data-size="line">-<img src="../../.gitbook/assets/RATIONALNUMBERS.png" alt="" data-size="line">.

Sometimes we want to show that a number is divisible by another number, so to do that we can simply say:

Let's take the example where we would like to say that n divides m: "For an arbitrary k, where k<img src="../../.gitbook/assets/BELONGS.png" alt="" data-size="line"><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/NATURALNUMBERS.png" alt="" data-size="line">. We will have $$m=n*k$$ ". This can also be represented as n|m which would mean that n evenly divides m.

An integer is even if and only if, for an integer n, where n<img src="../../.gitbook/assets/BELONGS.png" alt="" data-size="line"><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/NATURALNUMBERS.png" alt="" data-size="line"> we have $$n=2*k$$, where k<img src="../../.gitbook/assets/BELONGS.png" alt="" data-size="line"><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/NATURALNUMBERS.png" alt="" data-size="line">. This would also mean that 2|n. If the number is odd we can simply say 2 Å‚ n.

Also another important information would be that an integer is prime when n > 1 and when it is divisible by exactly two integers, those integers being 1 and n.&#x20;
