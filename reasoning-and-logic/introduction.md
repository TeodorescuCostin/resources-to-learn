### Why Logic?

At first let's define why logic is important for us. Logic is important because computers work with precision. Even when a computer seems not to do anything it processes information in an efficient way. This is meant to be done so that every time a harder process will run on our digital computers, they are going to be prepared to finish it. Logic is also important in mathematics and philosophy.

In this part of our documentation the goal is to help you:

* Translate a logically precise claim to English, and from English
* Describe the operation of logical connectors and quantifiers
* Describe the notion of logical validity
* Explain and apply basic set operations
* Define and perform computation with functions, relations and equivalence classes
* Constract a direct or indirect proof
* Construct and inetrpret recursive definitions
* Identify what type of proof is appropriate for a given claim
* Construct the right function or relation given a description
