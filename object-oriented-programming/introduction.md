# Introduction

Java have had a very big impact to computer science due to its complexity and its features that it offeres. Java is a high level programming language but due to its JVM (Java Virtual Machine) it can be runned from any PC or Computer.&#x20;

Java is mainly associated to internet programming but it can also be scaled to many other uses. Due to its complexity many server sided apps are also runned on Java.

Java was initially called "Oak" but was renamed in 1995 when it was bought by Oracle. Java was meant to be a programming language scalable for embedded systems, because the other high language programs ( to be more specific C and C++ ) required a full C++ compiler targeted for that CPU.

Because Java was designed in the early stages of the programming era it is mostly inspired from C and C++. From C Java inherits its syntax and from C++ the object model.

An important detail to keep in mind is that Java didn't invented the wheel, but refined an already higly succesful programming language.
